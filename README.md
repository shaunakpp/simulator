# Simulator

MIPS Simulator for CMSC 611 by Shaunak Pagnis.

## Installation

You can skip to [Installing Project](#installing-project) if your machine has Ruby 2.6 installed.

### Installing Ruby

Check the ruby version you have installed on your machine by running:

`ruby -v`

If it is below `2.6`, please install ruby 2.6 by running the following commands:


`gpg2 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB`


`curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`


Then add following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

`export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.rvm/bin"`

Once that is completed, run `source ~/.bashrc`

Once that is completed, you can now install correct version of Ruby by running:

`rvm install ruby-2.6.4`

 and

`rvm use ruby-2.6.4`

### Installing Project

Now that you have correct ruby installed we need to install dependencies for this project and generate executables.
This can be done by following the below steps:

* Run `gem install bundler`
* `cd` into the project directory
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `rake install` to install the project


## Usage

Now you can run the project by running:

`simulator examples/test_cases/test_case_3/inst.txt examples/test_cases/test_case_3/data.txt examples/test_cases/test_case_3/reg.txt examples/test_cases/test_case_3/config.txt examples/test_cases/test_case_3/output.txt`

You can also provide your own file_paths, but remember, the correct sequence for files is:

* Instruction file
* Data file
* Registers file
* Configuration files
* Output file


All the test cases are in `test_cases` directory. For your convience, all `test_cases` have an existing file `output.txt` that is generated by running this project.
